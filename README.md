# cribbage_scorer 

Cribbage scorer is a simple scoring engine for the classic card game.

For details, history and a good summary of the rules of the game see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage)

For instruction on how to play and the rules see the [American Cribbage Congress](http://www.cribbage.org/NewSite/rules)

### Installation 
```bash
pip install cribbage-scorer
```

## Scoring

Examples of how to use the library are below.

In the library and examples, I have used the following conventions:

- 1 : Ace
- 2-10 : Non face cards.
- 11 : Jack
- 12 : Queen
- 13 : King

D = Diamonds,
H = Hearts,
C = Clubs,
S = Spades.

Players are listed in the order in which they play. So...
1. _Abi_ played a 5 of Diamonds, 
1. _Bob_ played a 5 of Spades, 
1. _Abi_ played a 5 of Clubs 
1. _Bob_ played a Jack of Diamonds.

...is represented as:
```python 
players = ["Abi", "Bob"]
played_cards = [(5, "D"), (5, "S"), (5, "C"), (11, "D")]
```


### The Cut
The `cut_calc_score` function is used during 'the cut' stage of the game.

Its a simple function, to assign the 2 points given to the dealer if the pone cuts a Jack as the starter card.

```python

from cribbage_scorer import cribbage_scorer

cut_card = (11, "D")
players = ["Abi", "Bob"]
dealer = "Bob"

scores, msg  = cribbage_scorer.cut_calc_score(cut_card, players, dealer)
print(scores, msg )
```

Results:
```bash
{'Abi': 0, 'Bob': 2} Cut card is a Jack, Dealer scores 2pts.
```

### The Play

The `play_calc_score_set` function is used during 'the play' stage of the game.

`play_calc_score_set` handles 3 and 4 players as well as the standard 2 player game. It also understands "Go" calls.

Note: we use the term 'set' here to refer to a subset of the play, where the players are counting from a first played card upto either last card, Go or 31.
Once the players have ended a set the cards are put aside and another set begins until all cards are played.
The 'play' section of the game usually constitutes multiple sets.

To use, clone from GitHub and run this Python code:
```python

from cribbage_scorer import cribbage_scorer

players = ["Abi", "Bob"]
played_cards = [(5, "D"), (5, "S"), (5, "C"), (11, "D")]

scores, current_count, play_log = cribbage_scorer.play_calc_score_set(played_cards, players)
print(scores, current_count, play_log)
```

Results:
```bash
{'Abi': 8, 'Bob': 3} 25 ['Count: 5, No Points scored, None said Go. ', 'Count: 10, Bob: 2 of a kind (2pts), score so far: 2 ', 'Count: 15, Abi: 15 for 2pts, 3 of a kind (6pts), score so far: 8 ', 'Count: 25, Bob: Last card (1pt), score so far: 3 ']
```

Behind the scenes this method calls `play_score_ongoing` for each card placed down. This provides the scoring and message for each card placed.
You may choose to use this more internal method, to provide details of each card played, though the full play to that point in time requires `play_calc_score_set` to be used.

### The Show
The `show_calc_score` function is used during 'the show' stage of the game.

`show_calc_score` handles Dealer and non dealer hands, for the standard 6 card (4 in your hand, 2 given to the crib) + starter/cut card version of the game.

To use, clone from GitHub and run this Python code:
```python

from cribbage_scorer import cribbage_scorer

starter = (5, "D")
hand = [(5, "D"), (5, "S"), (5, "C"), (11, "D")]
crib = False

score, msg = cribbage_scorer.show_calc_score(starter, hand, crib)
print(score, msg)
```
Results:
```
(29, "Four of a kind: 5s (12pts), Made 15 from [(5, 'D'), (11, 'D')] (2pts), Made 15 from [(5, 'S'), (11, 'D')] (2pts), Made 15 from [(5, 'C'), (11, 'D')] (2pts), Made 15 from [(11, 'D'), (5, 'D')] (2pts), Made 15 from [(5, 'D'), (5, 'S'), (5, 'C')] (2pts), Made 15 from [(5, 'D'), (5, 'S'), (5, 'D')] (2pts), Made 15 from [(5, 'D'), (5, 'C'), (5, 'D')] (2pts), Made 15 from [(5, 'S'), (5, 'C'), (5, 'D')] (2pts), One for his nobs (1pt)")
```
